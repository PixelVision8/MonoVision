# Pixel Vision 8: MonoVision

MonoVision is a stripped down version of ([MonoGame](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame)) designed specifically for Pixel Vision 8. It is optimized to run 2D games and removes a lot of the overhead of the MonoGame Framework in favor of stripping the game engine down to its SDL2 code. Currently, MonoVision runs on desktops (Win, Mac, and Linux).
